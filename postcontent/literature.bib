	abstract = {Time delay estimation (TDE) is commonly performed in practice by crosscorrelation of digitized echo signals. Since time delays are generally not integral multiples of the sampling period, the location of the largest sample of the crosscorrelation function (ccf) is an inexact estimator of the location of the peak. Therefore, one must interpolate between the samples of the ccf to improve the estimation precision. Using theory and simulations, we review and compare the performance of several methods for interpolation of the ccf. The maximum likelihood approach to interpolation is the application of a reconstruction filter to the discrete ccf. However, this method can only be approximated in practice and can be computationally intensive. For these reasons, a simple method is widely used that involves fitting a parabola (or other curve) to samples of the ccf in the neighborhood of its peak. We describe and compare two curve-fitting methods: parabolic and cosine interpolation. Curve-fitting interpolation can yield biased time-delay estimates, which may preclude the use of these methods in some applications. The artifactual effect of these bias errors on elasticity imaging by elastography is discussed. We demonstrate that reconstructive interpolation is unbiased. An iterative implementation of the reconstruction procedure is proposed that can reduce the Computation time significantly.}

	abstract="Time delay estimation has been a research topic of significant practical importance in many fields (radar, sonar, seismology, geophysics, ultrasonics, hands-free communications, etc.). It is a first stage that feeds into subsequent processing blocks for identifying, localizing, and tracking radiating sources. This area has made remarkable advances in the past few decades, and is continuing to progress, with an aim to create processors that are tolerant to both noise and reverberation. This paper presents a systematic overview of the state-of-the-art of time-delay-estimation algorithms ranging from the simple cross-correlation method to the advanced blind channel identification based techniques. We discuss the pros and cons of each individual algorithm, and outline their inherent relationships. We also provide experimental results to illustrate their performance differences in room acoustic environments where reverberation and noise are commonly encountered.",
