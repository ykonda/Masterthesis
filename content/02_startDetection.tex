\section{Signal Start Detection}
\label{sec:02_signalStartDetection}

One focus of the whistle signal localization is the correct choice of the
signal frame, with which the \ac{TDOA} measurement is done.
In order to perform the \ac{FFT} most efficiently, the size of one frame
should be a power of 2.
Assuming that the clearest signal without reverberation and with minimal
multipath propagated subsignals is at the start of a sound signal,
the frame to investigate is chosen to be at the beginning of a whistle sound.
Several methods exist and can be combined at will.
In the next subsections, signal start detection using entropy, energy and
zero crossing rate are subject of discussion.
