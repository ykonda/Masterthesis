\section{Generalized Cross Correlation}
The generalized cross correlation is super duper nice.

- improve normal cross correlation\\
- whistle frequency between 2000Hz and 4000Hz (low-pass)\\
- thus, the peaks of the cross-correlation are wide\\
- to avoid this circumstance, the generalized cross correlation (GCC)
was introduced by Knapp and Carter 1976 \cite{Knapp_Carter_GCC} \\
- weightings before iFFT to maximize expected signal peak relative
to output noise \cite{Hassab_Boucher_GCC}
