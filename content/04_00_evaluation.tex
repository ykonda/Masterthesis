\chapter{Evaluation}

At first, the results of the methods on single robots must be investigated
in order to evaluate the performance of the final localization algorithm.
Depending on the accuracy of the individual direction results, the quality
of the team decision is limited.

Primary, whistle sounds were recorded in the laboratory of the HULKs.
If not emphasized particularly, the height of the sound source is 1.5\si{m}.
% signal start detection evaluation

First, the result of the direction detection on one robot
is examined profoundly with one measurement as an example.
There, we focus on the correctness and precision of the different methods.
To investigate the final localization of the team, measurements were
done with five robots on the field.
At the end, all measurements are used to assess the methods in a general matter.

In the following, the correlation function $R_{x_ax_b}$ of two signals
$x_a$ and $x_b$ as in \cref{chap:02_prerequisites} is shortened
to $R_{ab}$ for simplicity.
