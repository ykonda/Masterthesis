\chapter{Evaluation}

\todo[inline]{Allgemeine Anmerkung: Ich finde es persoenlich bei diesen
Kapiteleinleitungen schoener, wenn die "section" immer am Anfang des satzes steht
damit man nicht vor und zur√ºck springt. Aber das ist geschmackssache.}

In this chapter, experimental results are presented while setting
focus on different aspects.
Before evaluating the performance of the final localization algorithm the prediction
accuracy on a single robot is examined.
For this purpose, the results of the direction detection methods is examined and
discussed at the example of a single measurement in \cref{sec:04_tdoaSingle}.
There, the focus is set on the \ac{TDOA} methods itself for each channel pair
before combining them to a robot direction result.

% Additional Info
In \cref{chap:03_implementation}, the presence of determinable supplementary
information \todo{Was meinst du mit "determinable supplementary information"?} was
discussed regarding the \ac{SNR}, \ac{PSNR} and distance approximation. If and to
what extent these factors are applicable for the source localization is analysed in
\cref{sec:04_additionalInformation}.

% Team filter
To investigate the whistle sound source localization of the robots as team,
measurements were taken with five Naos on the field of the HULKs' laboratory
as specified in \cref{subsec:04_labMeasurements}.
The results of the \ac{TDOA} methods for all measurements are presented and
compared in \cref{sec:04_teamEvaluation} to have a closer look at their
performance.\todo{"to have a closer look at their performance" scheint redundant
hier}
Depending on the accuracy of the individual direction results, the quality
of the team filter is limited.
Therefore, the angular error of the single robots is demonstrated for each
measurement and method in addition.\todo{"in addition" scheint redundant}

Unless otherwise noted, measurements presented in this chapter were recorded in the
laboratory of the HULKs and are taken from a sound source at a height of
\SI{1.5}{\meter} above ground.
