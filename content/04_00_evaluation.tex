\chapter{Evaluation}

In this chapter, experimental results are presented while setting
focus on different aspects.
At first, the results of the methods on single robots must be investigated
before evaluating the performance of the final localization algorithm.
Thus, the results of the direction detection methods
is examined profoundly on one robot taking one measurement as example
in \cref{sec:04_tdoaSingle}.
There, the focus is set on the \ac{TDOA} methods itself for each channel pair
before combining them to a robot direction result.

% Additional Info
In \cref{chap:03_implementation}, the presence of determinable supplementary
information was discussed regarding the \ac{SNR}, \ac{PSNR} and distance
approximation.
If and in what extent these factors are applicable for the source localization
is analysed in \cref{sec:04_additionalInformation}.

% Team filter
To investigate the whistle sound source localization of the robots as team,
measurements were done with five Naos on the field of the HULKs' laboratory
as specified in \cref{subsec:04_labMeasurements}.
The results of the \ac{TDOA} methods for all measurements are presented and
compared in \cref{sec:04_teamEvaluation} to have a closer look at their performance.
Depending on the accuracy of the individual direction results, the quality
of the team filter is limited.
Therefore, the angular error of the single robots is demonstrated for each
measurement and method in addition.

Primary, whistle sounds were recorded in the laboratory of the HULKs.
If not emphasized particularly, the height of the sound source is 1.5\si{m}.
