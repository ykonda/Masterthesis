\chapter{Prerequisites}

- To localize a whistle sound source, it must be detected firstly (was done by previous work
and is implemented)
- calculate the direction of the whistle sound on one Nao\\
- This can be done by determining the \ac{TDOA} of microphone pairs\\
- With the delay, the angle of the sound source relative to angle pair
can be is known.\\
- By combining these, a direction ray is defined on each Nao\\
- The results are filtered by updating it with the singe rays, assuming
gaussian distribution. (known error, Trigonometry)

- why other theories do not fit into this problem
(finger printing, beam forming)
