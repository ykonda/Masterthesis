For the whistle sound source localization with multiple robots, some
sequential steps needs to interact for a final result.
To work with the implementations in \cref{chap:03_implementation}, the fundamentals
are introduced in this chapter on a general basis.

As this work specializes on the localization of a whistle sound, this sound pattern
must be detected at first.
This was already done by previous work \cite{Hasselbring}.
Hence, the flow of the whistle detection is only briefly explained in \cref{sec:02_whistleSignal}.
The position of the sound source is determined by combining
separate direction results on the single robots.
Utilizing the \ac{TDOA} information referenced in \cref{sec:02_tdoa} between pairs
of the Naos' microphones, every robot produces a sound direction ray which
are fed into the team decision filter.
As mentioned in \cref{chap:01_introduction}, different methods exist to identify the \ac{TDOA}
and are terms of content in \cref{sec:02_cc,sec:02_gcc,sec:02_phase}.
Due to the low resolution arising from the sample rate and small distance between the microphones,
a subsample estimation is stated in \cref{sec:02_subsampleShift}.
One of the most significant factors is the selection of the signal frame that is going to
be used for the direction determination.
In order to provide a correct and stable decision process, different approaches
are considered.
In all cases, the focus is on finding the signal starting index
and are listed in \cref{sec:02_signalStartDetection}.
After all, the results of the individual robots are filtered by assuming
gaussian distribution to produce a sound source position.
\Cref{sec:02_filter} describes the formulas for Bayesian Updating.
