\chapter{Prerequisites}

- To localize a whistle sound source, it must be detected firstly (was done by previous work
and is implemented)
- calculate the direction of the whistle sound on one Nao\\
- This can be done by determining the \ac{TDOA} of microphone pairs\\
- With the delay, the angle of the sound source relative to angle pair
can be is known.\\
- By combining these, a direction ray is defined on each Nao\\
- The results are filtered by updating it with the singe rays, assuming
gaussian distribution. (known error, Trigonometry)

- why other theories do not fit into this problem
(finger printing, beam forming)

- CC in time domain, because low frequency resolution (44100Hz/512Samples=resolution)
and also \ac{CC} corrupted and we want to detect which signal was first
- reverberation is a problem and assumed as not multi-path system
- entropy for large scale start detection
- zcr and energy for smaller scale (because high precision needed)
