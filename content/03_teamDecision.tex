\section{Team Decision}
\label{sec:03_teamDecision}

To agree on a whistle position as multi-agent system, the detected sound source
direction is added into the team message as float.
Depending on the implementation, additional information like distance or
\ac{PSNR} can be appended.

For the evaluation of the methods, the team decision is implemented in
python for offline analysis of the sample data.
Therefore, the result is computed for each robot and introduced into
the team decision filter as direction ray. %with covariance and distance
% is front or rear
Each value input is paired with the other rays. If they cross, the
filter is updated with this intersection until all pairs of direction
rays are being considered.

For the real case, a team whistle localization module is
introduced into the HULKs' framework.
Here, each robots fills the result of the determined direction into
the team message.
