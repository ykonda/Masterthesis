\section{Whistle Signal}
\label{sec:02_whistleSignal}

In this work the localization of a whistle sound source is to be to the fore.
The detection of such a signal is implemented as stated in \cite{Hasselbring}.\\
\missing[inline]{
- short explanation of how the whistle is detected\\
- whistle sound is around 2000Hz and 4000Hz
}

Further on, the mathematical model of a received whistle signal at one microphone sensor
is defined as
\be
x(t) = s(t) + n(t)
\label{eq:02_whistleSignal}
\ee
where $s(t)$ represents the signal and $n(t)$ noise.
Both are real, jointly stationary random processes.
