% - why other theories do not fit into this problem (like finger printing, beam forming)
% Another approach would be the TDOA between the robots. Therefore, the robots needs to
% be synchronized in time. The whistle detection time point can then be taken for calculating
% the time difference of arrival. The distance between the robots needs to be known
% Robots needs to be synchronized (which is difficult with NTP only)
