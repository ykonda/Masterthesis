\section{Signal Phase Difference}
\label{sec:02_phase}

With a different approach to the correlation methods, the \ac{TDOA} can be
detected by observing the phase of one certain frequency.
The phase of a signal frequency is easily computable in frequency domain
with
\bal
    \phi(f) &= tan^{-1}(\frac{imag(X(f))}{real(X(f))}).\\
\intertext{With the difference of the phases of two channel, the delay is defined as}
    D &= \frac{\Delta \phi \cdot c_s}{2 \pi \cdot f}.\\
\eal
From that, the impingement angle calculation of \cref{eq:02_tdoaAngle} can
be followed.
