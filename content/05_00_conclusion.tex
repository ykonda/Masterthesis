    - Objective of this work:
        x a whistle sound locator (in xy-plane) with multiple robots
        x stationary robots and sources
        x evaluated different tdoa methods
        - found a approach to detect direction of source on single robots

The purpose of this work was to find an approach to localize a whistle
signal with a multi-agent system consisting of multiple NAO robots.
Each of these robots have four microphones attached on their head which
record audio signals within a range of 150\si{\hertz} and 12\si{\kilo\hertz}
with a sample rate of 44.1\si{\kilo\hertz}.
Only stationary sound sources and robots were considered in the scope of this
work.
Roughly, the implementation can be divided into three parts.
Of capital importance is the \acf{WSDE} executed by stand-alone robots which
is realized by computing the \ac{TDOA} between the four channels on the robots' head.
Two fundamentally different approaches were evaluated to obtain a stable method
for the delay estimation.
One obtains the \ac{TDOA} by cross-correlating signal samples with standard
\acf{CC} and \acf{GCC-PHAT} algorithms in frequency domain.
The other analyses recorded samples in frequency domain in terms of
a phase of a reference frequency which is described as \acf{PD} method.
% Correct
It was assumed that the start of a signal is most reliable 
To circumvent impact of multi-path propagation and reverberation, 
was investigated and is true
Thus, \acf{SSD} approaches were compared with regard to accuracy and computational effort.
