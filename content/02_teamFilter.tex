\section{Bayesian Updating}
\label{sec:02_filter}

Assuming gaussian distribution of the single robot results,
the multi-agent decision process is done by Bayesian Updating.
One dimensional probability density functions of states with
variance $\sigma^2$ and mean $\mu$ are described as
\bal
    \mathcal{N}(x,\sigma,\mu) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{(x-\sigma)^2}{2\sigma^2}}.
    \label{eq:02_probabilityDensity}
\eal
Having two values $\mu_0$ and $\mu_1$ with their variances,
the result $\mu'$ of the combination of both is
\bal
    \mathcal{N}(x,\sigma',\mu') = \mathcal{N}(x,\sigma_0',\mu_0') \cdot \mathcal{N}(x,\sigma_1',\mu_1').
    \label{eq:02_newProbabilityDensity}
\eal
By substitution and conversion, $\mu'$ and $\sigma'^2$ can be
formulated to
\bsub
\bal
    \mu' &= \mu_0 + \frac{\sigma_0^2(\mu_1-\mu_0)}{\sigma_0^2+\sigma_1^2}\\
    \sigma'^2 &= \sigma_0^2 - \frac{\sigma_0^4}{\sigma_0^2+\sigma_1^2}.
