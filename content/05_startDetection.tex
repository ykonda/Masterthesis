\section{Start Detection}
\label{sec:05_startDetection}

If the observed signal is known as whistle and computational effort is
irrelevant, 
% the evaluation shows that the start detection with the
% existing whistle detection algorithm performs best.
that a rough start detection by the exiting whistle detection
with a large frame size followed by a \ac{ZCR} detection with small
window size.
This is a good trade-off with regard to the computational effort.
% - entropy for large scale start detection\\
% - zcr and energy for smaller scale (because high precision needed)\\
