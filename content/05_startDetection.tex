\subsection{Start Detection Conclusion}
\label{subsec:04_startDetectionConclusion}

If the start of a whistle sound is wanted and computational effort is
neglected, the evaluation shows that the start detection with the
existing whistle detection algorithm performs best.
that a rough start detection by the exiting whistle detection
with a large frame size followed by a \ac{ZCR} detection with small
window size.
This is a good trade-off with regard to the computational effort.
\change[inline]{change for more noisy signals? -> then maybe entropy?}
% - entropy for large scale start detection\\
% - zcr and energy for smaller scale (because high precision needed)\\
