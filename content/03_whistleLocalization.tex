\section{Whistle Source Direction Estimation} \todo{whistle-source direction esimation}
\label{subsec:03_directionEstimation}

% started with \ac{WSDE}
By one stand-alone system in form of a robot with four microphones
attached on the head, only the direction of a sound source can be
estimated. \todo{der Satz klingt etwas holprig durch den Anfang. Vielleicht etwas in die Richtung: Considering only one stand-alone system, i.e. one robot with four microphones, only the direction of a sound source can be estimated}
As shortly introduced in \cref{subsec:03_whistleLocalizationStructure},
the \lstinline!WhistleDirectionEstimation! module is responsible to
determine the direction of the whistle-sound detected by the \lstinline!WhistleDetection!.
Before going into detail, the overall structure of the \ac{WSDE} on a single robot
is summarized by means of \cref{fig:04_stateMachine}.

\lstinline!WhistleDirectionEstimation! depends on the data type \lstinline!WhistleData!
which is a production of \lstinline!WhistleDetection!. \todo{ich hab "is a production of" noch nie so gelesen. Vielleicht eher "is produced by" oder "originates from " oder so?}
Currently\todo{wann ist currently? In dieser Sekunde, bevor du das weiterentwickelt hast? Besser beschreiben!}, it contains two values. A timestamp when the whistle was last detected
and a boolean value if a whistle start is found.
Until this value is set to true by the \lstinline!WhistleDetection!, the
\lstinline!WhistleDirectionEstimation! buffers up to
44100 audio samples per channel.
As a whistle needs to be detected for multiple cycles in a short time, one can
be sure that the buffer contains a number of whistle samples.

Out of the buffered samples, the signal start is calculated by the \ac{SSD}
which will be further described in \cref{sec:02_signalStartDetection}. \todo{jetzt sind wir aber schon in section 3.2 oder so. Also eher "has been described" ?}

According to the \ac{TDOA} method, frames considered for the delay estimation
are chosen differently \todo{differently from what?}.
Detailed descriptions are given in the corresponding method
\cref{subsubsec:03_cc,subsubsec:03_phase}.
In \ac{TDOA}, the delays between the two microphone channels are
determined by either \ac{GCC-PHAT}, \ac{CC} or phase difference method. \todo{holprig, eher: Using TDOA, the delay(s) between two microphone challes are either determined by xxx, yyy or the zzz method.}
Each delay generates two potential source direction candidates as stated
in \cref{sec:02_tdoa}.
In the event of candidates indicating a nearby signal from straight forward or
backwards, the distance to the source is estimated in addition.
More precise explanation is given in \cref{subsec:03_distance}.
For a final direction, the mean of the candidates with smallest difference
is formed. \todo{wie ist difference definiert? Das ist hier unklar, scheint mir aber wichtig zu sein}

If one of the correlation methods is used, the \ac{TDOA} is calculated
multiple times by shifting the frame over samples.
The range in which the frame is shifted around the start index is parameterized
as well as the size of the shift. \todo{The shift range around the start index, as well as the size of the shift, are parameterized.}
By saving the calculated \ac{TDOA} values and looking up \todo{checking?} certain conditions per frame shift,
the most promising \todo{etwas klarer waere hier etwas wie: best result according to the metric given in eq. XX } result can be chosen.
This way, potential start estimation inaccuracies can be corrected and
the decision process is optimized.
In case of the \ac{GCC-PHAT}, the \ac{PSNR} provides information about
the certainty of the \ac{TDOA} estimation as \cref{subsec:04_psnr} proves\todo{mit "proves" waere ich immer etwas vorsichtig. Vielleicht eher "shows" oder "as shown in"}.
A frame shift delivers \ac{TDOA} values for each channel pair and a
mean of all \acp{PSNR} from the \ac{GCC} functions.
Comparing the frame shifts, the \ac{TDOA} results with
greatest \ac{PSNR} mean value is assumed as best performing.
The same procedure is done with the \ac{CC} method but by examining
the greatest \ac{CC} function value.

Regardless of the method, the production of this module is a
\lstinline!WhistleDirection! data type which contains calculated
direction outcome in radians and additional information like distance or \ac{PSNR}.

All transformations into frequency domain and inverse transformations
are executed with the \ac{FFTW} library just as the \lstinline!WhistleDetection!.
For parallel development in Python, the widespread package \textit{NumPy} \todo{version} delivers
all fundamental functions for computation in frequency domain.
