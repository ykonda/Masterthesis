\section{Whistle Source Direction Estimation}
\label{subsec:03_directionEstimation}

% started with \ac{WSDE}
By one stand-alone system in form of a robot with four microphones
attached on the head, only the direction of a sound source can be
estimated.
As shortly introduced in \cref{subsec:03_whistleLocalizationStructure},
the \lstinline!WhistleDirectionEstimation! module is responsible to
determine the direction of the whistle sound detected by the \lstinline!WhistleDetection!.
Before going into detail, the overall structure of the \ac{WSDE} on a single robot
is summarized by means of \cref{fig:04_stateMachine}.

\lstinline!WhistleDirectionEstimation! depends on the data type \lstinline!WhistleData!
which is a production of \lstinline!WhistleDetection!.
Currently, it contains two values. A timestamp when the whistle was last detected
and a boolean value if a whistle start is found.
Until this value is set to true by the \lstinline!WhistleDetection!, the
\lstinline!WhistleDirectionEstimation! buffers up to
44100 audio samples per channel.
As a whistle needs to be detected for multiple cycles in a short time, one can
be sure that the buffer contains a number of whistle samples.

Out of the buffered samples, the signal start is calculated by the \ac{SSD}
which will be further described in \cref{sec:02_signalStartDetection}.

According to the \ac{TDOA} method, frames considered for the delay estimation
are chosen differently.
Detailed descriptions are given in the corresponding method
\cref{subsubsec:03_cc,subsubsec:03_phase}.
By \ac{TDOA} the delays between the two microphone channels are
determined by either \ac{GCC-PHAT}, \ac{CC} or phase difference method.
Each delay generates two potential source direction candidates as stated
in \cref{sec:02_tdoa}.
In the event of candidates indicating a nearby signal from straight forward or
backwards, the distance to the source is estimated in addition.
More precise explanation is given in \cref{subsec:03_distance}.
For a final direction, the mean of the candidates with smallest difference
is formed.

If one of the correlation methods are used, the \ac{TDOA} is calculated
multiple times shifting the frame over samples.
The range in which the frame is shifted around the start index is parameterized
as well as the size of the shift.
By saving the calculated \ac{TDOA} values and looking up certain conditions per frame shift,
the most promising result can be chosen.
This way, potential start estimation inaccuracies can be corrected and
decision process is optimized.
In case of the \ac{GCC-PHAT}, the \ac{PSNR} provides information about
the certainty of the \ac{TDOA} estimation as \cref{subsec:04_psnr} proves.
A frame shift delivers \ac{TDOA} values for each channel pair and a
mean of all \acp{PSNR} from the \ac{GCC} functions.
Comparing the frame shifts, the \ac{TDOA} results with
greatest \ac{PSNR} mean value is assumed as best performing.
The same procedure is done with the \ac{CC} method but by examining
the greatest \ac{CC} function value.

Regardless of the method, the production of this module is a
\lstinline!WhistleDirection! data type which contains calculated
direction outcome in radians and additional information like distance or \ac{PSNR}.

All transformations into frequency domain and inverse transformations
are executed with the \ac{FFTW} library just as the \lstinline!WhistleDetection!.
For parallel development in Python, the widespread package \textit{NumPy} delivers
all fundamental functions for computation in frequency domain.
