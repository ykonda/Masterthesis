\chapter{Implementation}
\label{chap:03_implementation}

In this chapter, the implementation details for the whistle sound
localization \todo{ich wuerde schreiben: whistle-sound localization. Dann ist das schoener getrennt. Den Tipp hab ich letztens auch bekommen. MÃ¼sste dann natuerlich in der ganzen Arbeit geaendert werden.} are introduced briefly. \todo{I would write "are explained" or something similar because "details" and "introduced briefly" seem to be slightly contradicting}
All audio data used in this work are recorded within the HULKs' framework
on the NAO robots.
Prior to realizing the sound localization on the hardware of NAO robots,
a large part of the algorithms were implemented in Python \todo{version} independently
for easier debugging and evaluation.
