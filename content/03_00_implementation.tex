\chapter{Implementation}
\label{chap:03_implementation}

In this chapter, the implementation details for the whistle sound
localization are introduced briefly.
All audio data used in this work are recorded within the HULKs' framework
on the NAO robots.
Prior to realizing the sound localization on the hardware of NAO robots,
a large part of the algorithms were implemented in Python independently
for easier debugging and evaluation.

% only 3 pairs are used
