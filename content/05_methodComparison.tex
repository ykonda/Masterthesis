% Phase method: Much faster!

% GCC is more accurate in regard to each robot result -> This is
% important when less robots are used for localization.
% It can be the case when robots are broken / got penalty
% We want each robot result to be as accurate as possible so
% that we can count on each result
% Less robots means, that each wrong direction is weighted more
% and influences the final position significantly.
