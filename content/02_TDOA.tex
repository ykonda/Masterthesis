\section{Time Difference Of Arrival}

The direction of a signal source can be computed by the relative time delay between
two microphones.
- describe how the direction is defined by TDOA
It is assumed that the distance from the sensors to the sound source is
significantly large so that the signal waves proceed parallel.
Then, calculations for the direction of the sound source can be done with a simple
geometrical approach like done in \cite{Valin_Michaud}.

With the definition of a whistle signal as stated in \ref{eq:02_whistleSignal},
the microphone sensors $mic_1$ and $mic_2$ will output
\bsub \bal
    x_1(t) &= s(t) + n_1(t)\\
    x_2(t) &= \alpha s(t - D) + n_2(t).
\eal \esub
\label{eq:02_signalTimeDomain}
Here, $D$ is the delay of $x_2$ relative to $x_1$ for which is looked for.
